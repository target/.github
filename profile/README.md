# Open Source at Target

Open source software is a core building block for Target’s technology team,
and a key component of our strategy as we work to build innovative experiences
for our guests and efficient software solutions for our teams.
Our technology team members are encouraged by their leaders
to not only use open source solutions in their day-to-day work,
but also to contribute back to the broader ecosystem as active community members.

## Our Strategy

Target’s Open Source Program Office (OSPO) advocates for open and innersource solutions as a strategic business differentiator.
We prioritize open source engagement not only to help us advance our goals
but also to advance technical efforts beyond Target and the retail industry as a whole.
We aim to equip leaders and technologists with the tools they need to be more effective
and recognize security and compliance as table stakes as we share our expertise and innovations with our community.

## Our Open Source Fund

In our experience, a strong open source practice leads to transformative, innovative, and collaborative outcomes for all involved.
We are inspired by the work done at other companies to directly fund eligible open source foundations, communities, and projects.
We are thrilled to operate our own [Open Source Fund][fund] at Target.
We hope to strengthen the open source movement,
encourage continued enthusiastic engagement by our teams, and
establish our support by contributing financially back to the community and ecosystem.
